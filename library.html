    <h1>LIBRARY</h1>

    <p>This will contain things I've written that aren't necessarily about a project. For example, I made a game that
        is inspired by autistic people's experiences with masking. Here I would put an explanation of what masking is,
        which I could then link to from the project. I'm hoping this will declutter things when I inevitably start
        ranting</p>
